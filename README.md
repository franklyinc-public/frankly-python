#Frankly Python SDK

The Python module makes it easy to create deeper Frankly chat integrations in your app by interacting with Frankly's server APIs for managing Rooms, Messages, and Users.

###Installation

The frankly module can be installed like most python modules using pip:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/franklyinc/frankly-python.git#egg=frankly
```

###Documentation

Please fine the complete Python integration guide and API reference, generated from [pdoc](https://github.com/BurntSushi/pdoc), at
[http://franklyinc.github.io/frankly-python](http://franklyinc.github.io/frankly-python/).


###Making Improvements

Frankly Platform provides a great way for brands to integrate chat in their iOS, Android, and Web apps in order to build and engage their communities. But of course, that's not possible without developers like you. Have ideas for improving the integration experience? Let us know by creating a Github issue in this repo!


###Access & Support

Right now Frankly Platform is limited in access. If you'd like to learn more about how to get access, please reach out to us by emailing [platform-support@franklychat.com](mailto:platform-support@franklychat.com).
